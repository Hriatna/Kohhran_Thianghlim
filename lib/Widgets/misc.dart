What must a book review contain?
Like all works of art, no two book reviews will be identical. But fear not: there are a few guidelines for any aspiring book reviewer to follow. Most book reviews, for instance, are less than 1,500 words long, with the sweet spot hitting somewhere around the 1,000-word mark. (However, this may vary depending on the platform on which you‚Äôre writing, as we‚Äôll see later.)

In addition, all reviews share some universal elements, as shown in our book review templates. These include:

A review will offer a concise plot summary of the book. 
A book review will offer an evaluation of the work. 
A book review will offer a recommendation for the audience. 
If these are the basic ingredients that make up a book review, it‚Äôs the tone and style with which the book reviewer writes that brings the extra panache. This will differ from platform to platform, of course. A book review on Goodreads, for instance, will be much more informal and personal than a book review on Kirkus Reviews, as it is catering to a different audience. However, at the end of the day, the goal of all book reviews is to give the audience the tools to determine whether or not they‚Äôd like to read the book themselves.

Keeping that in mind, let‚Äôs proceed to some book review examples to put all of this in action. """;
